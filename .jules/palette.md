## PALETTE'S JOURNAL - CRITICAL LEARNINGS ONLY

## 2026-02-13 - [Brand Color Contrast Failure]
**Learning:** The brand color `#667eea` fails WCAG AA contrast (3.4:1) against white backgrounds, affecting accessibility for text headers and primary buttons.
**Action:** Replace `#667eea` with `#4f46e5` (Indigo 600) which passes WCAG AA (5.5:1) while maintaining brand identity. Update all instances including `manifest.json`.
