## 2024-07-25 - MQL5 Native Functions vs. Scripted Loops
**Learning:** My assumption that a manual MQL5 loop over a pre-cached array would be faster than built-in functions like `iHighest()` and `iLowest()` was incorrect. The code review pointed out that MQL5's native, built-in functions are implemented in highly optimized C++ and are significantly faster than loops executed in the MQL5 scripting layer. The original comment stating this was correct.
**Action:** Always prefer using MQL5's built-in, native functions for calculations like finding highs/lows over manual loops, even if the data is already in a local array. The performance gain from the native implementation outweighs the overhead of the function call.

## 2026-01-19 - Native Object Cleanup in MQL5
**Learning:** While iterating through chart objects manually is flexible, it becomes a major bottleneck if the chart has thousands of objects. For simple prefix-based cleanup (often used in indicators), the native `ObjectsDeleteAll(0, prefix)` is significantly more efficient than a scripted loop calling `ObjectName()` and `StringFind()` for every object on the chart.
**Action:** Use `ObjectsDeleteAll()` for bulk object removal by prefix whenever the "keep N latest" logic is not strictly required or can be safely bypassed for performance.
