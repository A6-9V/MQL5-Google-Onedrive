## 2024-07-25 - MQL5 Native Functions vs. Scripted Loops
**Learning:** My assumption that a manual MQL5 loop over a pre-cached array would be faster than built-in functions like `iHighest()` and `iLowest()` was incorrect. The code review pointed out that MQL5's native, built-in functions are implemented in highly optimized C++ and are significantly faster than loops executed in the MQL5 scripting layer. The original comment stating this was correct.
**Action:** Always prefer using MQL5's built-in, native functions for calculations like finding highs/lows over manual loops, even if the data is already in a local array. The performance gain from the native implementation outweighs the overhead of the function call.

## 2024-07-26 - Native ArrayMaximum/ArrayMinimum Efficiency
**Learning:** Confirmed that native `ArrayMaximum()` and `ArrayMinimum()` are the preferred way to find extreme values in price arrays. Also, when using these functions, it's important to check if they return `-1` to avoid invalid array access, especially if the `count` or `start` parameters might be dynamic.
**Action:** When replacing manual loops with native array functions, always include a check for the `-1` return value to ensure robustness while gaining performance.
